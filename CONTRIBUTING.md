# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome and appreciated**.
This project started as a personal / hobby effort and is currently undergoing
refactoring to better support external contributions.

## Current status

At the moment:

* The codebase is **in transition**
* There are **no formally established contribution rules yet**
* Code style and structure are being cleaned up
* Tests are currently **minimal or absent**

Because of this, contributions are guided mainly by **common sense and
constructive intent**.

If something can be made clearer, simpler, or more idiomatic, feel free to
propose it, preferably in a focused and incremental way.

## How to contribute (for now)

* Small, well-scoped pull requests are preferred
* For larger changes, opening an issue first is recommended
* Please try to follow existing patterns in the codebase
* Avoid large "drive-by rewrites" unless discussed beforehand

There is no strict style guide yet; clarity and readability matter more than
perfection at this stage.

## Tests

* There are currently **no comprehensive tests**
* **Adding tests is very welcome**
* Any test contribution, even partial, is appreciated

A more structured testing strategy will be introduced as the refactoring
progresses.

## Future contribution standards

Once the refactoring phase is complete, contribution rules will be formalized.
The intent is to adopt standard Go tooling and practices, including:

* `gofmt` for formatting
* basic linting (to be defined)
* a minimal but consistent test suite
* clearer project structure and conventions

When these standards are established, they will become the expected baseline for
new contributions.
